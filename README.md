**Reflection on Projects**

In the projects for this course, I tackled the challenge of developing a command-line program in C++ to manage course data. The overarching problem was to create a program that could load course information from a file, organize it into a suitable data structure, and provide various functionalities such as printing course lists and retrieving course information.

To approach this problem, I first analyzed the requirements and identified the key components needed for the program. Understanding the importance of data structures was crucial in this process. By choosing appropriate data structures like vectors and structs, I ensured efficient storage and retrieval of course information. These data structures helped me manage the complexity of the program and handle large amounts of data effectively.

During the project, I encountered several roadblocks, such as dealing with file I/O and implementing sorting algorithms. However, I overcame these challenges by breaking down the tasks into smaller, manageable parts and seeking guidance from resources like documentation and online tutorials. Additionally, leveraging the power of libraries like `<algorithm>` in C++ enabled me to implement sorting functionalities efficiently.

Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by emphasizing the importance of modular design and code reusability. Breaking down the functionalities into separate functions allowed for easier debugging and maintenance. Moreover, incorporating best practices like meaningful variable names, inline comments, and modular functions enhanced the readability and adaptability of the codebase.

Overall, this project has evolved the way I write programs by reinforcing the significance of writing clean, maintainable, and adaptable code. It underscored the importance of understanding data structures and algorithms in designing efficient and scalable software solutions. Through this experience, I've gained valuable insights into the software development process and honed my skills in problem-solving and code craftsmanship.
